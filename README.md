# Mini Project 9: Cloud-Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation

## Introduction
In this project, we leverage the capabilities of cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebooks, specifically Google Colab, to perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset. The power of cloud computing allows us to handle, transform, and analyze data seamlessly without any local dependencies.

## Purpose of the Project
The main objective of this project is:
- To understand and set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook.
- To gain hands-on experience in performing data manipulation tasks in a cloud environment.

## Preparation
### Setting up the environment
1. The project uses Google Colab as the cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook platform.
2. To replicate and run the notebook:
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nogibjj/Mini_Project9_Yabei/blob/main/main.ipynb#scrollTo=5e8847be-469e-4739-80eb-ee48a754450e)
   - Click on `Open Notebook` and select the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) from this repository.

### Using the Makefile
This repository contains a `Makefile` that automates certain tasks to ease the setup and execution process. To utilize it:
1. Navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Run the appropriate `make` commands. For example:
- lint
   ```bash
   make lint
   ```
- test
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
- generate and push
   ```bash
   make generate_and_push
   ```


### Document
The repository includes a `document` markdown file that details all the data manipulation tasks. You can find it [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/Mini_Project9_Yabei/blob/main/Document.md)https://github.com/nogibjj/Mini_Project9_Yabei/blob/main/Document.md)
