# Mini Project 9

## Google Collab
https://colab.research.google.com/github/nogibjj/Mini_Project9_Yabei/blob/main/Mini_Project9.ipynb

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis for a car dataset, including a Jupyter notebook, a Python script, shared library functions, and automated testing and linting via Makefile and GitHub Actions.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A detailed notebook that demonstrates the data analysis process.
- **Python Script**: A standalone script for data analysis.
- **lib.py**: A shared library that contains common functions used by both the notebook and the script.
- **Makefile**: Automates the testing, linting, and formatting processes.
- **Requirements.txt**: Lists all the necessary Python packages for this project.

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook

The notebook provides a visual interface for data analysis. Ensure you have Jupyter installed and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook individual_project_1.ipynb
```

### Python Script

To execute the standalone script:

```bash
python script.py
```

### lib.py

This shared library contains essential functions for data analysis. It's used by both the notebook and the script.

### Makefile

The Makefile automates several tasks:

1. **Running Tests**: This will run tests for the notebook, script, and lib.

```bash
make test
```

2. **Formatting Code**: This will format the code using Python black.

```bash
make format
```

3. **Linting Code**: This will lint the code using Ruff.

```bash
make lint
```

### Testing

- **nbval plugin for pytest**: The Jupyter notebook is tested using the nbval plugin for pytest.
- **test_script.py**: Contains tests for the Python script.
- **test_lib.py**: Contains tests for the shared library.

To install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## GitHub Actions

Our repository uses GitHub Actions to automate the execution of all Makefile commands. Check the badges in this README for the status of each action.
